Homage to the Homage to the Square

## Quickstart

This repo uses `npx http-server` to serve static files to your browser.

1. Make sure you have npm installed. If you don't, I recommend using [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage your installations of Node.js and npm.

```
npm -v
```

2. Clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/0xOlias/homage.git && cd homage
```

3. Start the local server

```
./start
```

4. Open `http://127.0.0.1:8080` in your browser

5. When you make changes to `index.js`, just save the file and refresh the page
